# Mutable Rules
1. **Decision Process**: Proposals are submitted via the main TPS Signal group, voted on by active members (defined as those who have participated in the last 30 days) with a simple majority (50% + 1) within 7 days of posting.
2. **Active Membership**: Members must engage (e.g., vote, comment, or propose) at least once every 60 days to retain voting rights, with inactivity reviewed and status updated monthly by the Coordinator.
3. **Coordinator Role**: A volunteer Coordinator manages proposal tracking, Signal communication, and GitHub updates, elected by majority vote of active members every 3 months, with any member eligible to run.
4. **Funding**: Donations are accepted via a public Bitcoin address managed by the Coordinator, with expenditures over 0.01 BTC requiring a majority vote of active members.
5. **Amendments**: Mutable rules can be proposed for addition, removal, or modification through the decision process, with changes taking effect 24 hours after a majority vote is confirmed.
