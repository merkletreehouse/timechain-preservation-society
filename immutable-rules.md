# Immutable Rules
1. **Purpose Protection**: The TPSâ€™s mission is to educate the Bitcoin community about preserving the timechain as a clean ledger for financial transactions by discouraging non-financial spam (e.g., wash-traded shitcoins), and this purpose cannot be changed without unanimous consent of all active members.
2. **Open Membership**: Membership is free and open to anyone, with no identity required beyond a pseudonym, unless serving in a governance role, and this openness is unalterable without unanimous consent.
3. **Transparency**: All decisions, proposals, votes, and financial records must be publicly logged (e.g., on a GitHub repository), and this transparency requirement cannot be changed without unanimous consent.
4. **Non-Profit Ethos**: No earnings or assets of the TPS shall benefit private individuals; upon dissolution, assets must be transferred to a similar cause as determined by unanimous consent, and this principle is unalterable.
